# TabULearn

TabULearn is the desktop application guitarists need to learn their favorite songs faster than before. It's as simple as:

* Import your favorite songs to TabULearn.
* Look up how to play them in one click.
* Alter parts of the song that are difficult to learn, to make them easier. You can slow down sections of the song, and loop it until you are satisfied with your performance.

TabULearn also lets you track important data when it comes to playing songs, such as tuning, what kind of gear you played the song with, and more.
